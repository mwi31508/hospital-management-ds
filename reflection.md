# Reflection – Week 4

I worked mainly on implementing and testing queue and stack operations in the project.
Through this assignment, I learned how data structures are applied in real systems.
I also learned the importance of testing, debugging, and clean code organization.
If I had more time, I would improve error handling and add file-based data storage.
